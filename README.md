## Project Overview

**Operix** is a backend platform for pharmaceutical workload and operations management. It replaces fragmented Excel trackers with a centralized, role scoped system where operational work moves through defined workflows, every important action is audited, and analytics are derived from real business data.

The platform is designed for organizations that need more than basic task CRUD. It supports Admin and Member responsibility boundaries, task assignment and submission review, immutable activity history, management report approval, file evidence, Excel migration, dynamic XLSX exports, and Inventory V1.

At its core, Operix follows one product principle:

```text
Work → Activity → Data → Analytics → Decision
```

---

## Why This Project Matters

Spreadsheet based operational tracking is flexible, but it is difficult to govern. Ownership becomes unclear, revisions overwrite history, reports drift from source data, and leadership loses confidence in the numbers.

Operix turns that workflow into a backend system with:

- strict role isolation across `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, and `MEMBER`;
- deterministic Task and Management Report workflows;
- immutable submission, review, Activity, and Inventory ledgers;
- derived dashboards and performance metrics from the database source of truth;
- controlled Excel import and export without making Excel a parallel database.

It is intentionally built as a serious backend product, not a demo dashboard. The interesting engineering work lives in scoped authorization, transactional workflow integrity, idempotent import behavior, safe file handling, and analytics consistency.

## Architecture and Internal Workflow

Operix is a decoupled backend API. The frontend consumes REST endpoints under `/api/v1`, while the backend owns authentication, authorization, business workflow, database writes, and derived analytics.

### Request Lifecycle

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client      | Sends authenticated REST requests to `/api/v1`                             |
| Guards      | Resolve viewer identity, enforce account status, enforce role requirements |
| Controllers | Stay thin, validate DTOs, pass `OperixViewer` to services                  |
| Services    | Own scope checks, business rules, transactions, Activity, Notifications    |
| Prisma      | Performs typed database reads and writes                                   |
| PostgreSQL  | Stores operational truth and enforces critical constraints                 |

Task metadata and lifecycle history are visible to every active authenticated role. Attachment, file, submission, review, Dashboard, report, Activity, and Inventory authorization remains independently scoped. `Task.createdById` is the immutable Owner; `TaskAssignment.responsibleUserId` is the current executor. Recurring Tasks are DIRECT weekly/monthly series with one persisted reminder per occurrence.

## Quality Gate

Recommended before handing off a backend change:

```bash
pnpm prisma:validate
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test:unit
git diff --check
```

Integration tests require a separate test database:

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

Never run destructive integration tests against a development or production database.

## Public Identifier Contract

Database primary keys remain private to the backend. API route parameters and response `id`/`*Id` fields use PostgreSQL-generated UUIDs for externally addressable records. Services translate those UUIDs into private IDs before scope checks and business operations. Employee IDs, task reference codes, SKUs, emails, and names remain supported business identifiers.

This is a coordinated breaking contract: clients must send public UUIDs and must not expect Prisma CUIDs. Better Auth still uses private identity internally, while browser sign-in/session responses and `GET /api/v1/viewer/me` expose public Operix identity only. See `resource/better-auth-route-inventory.md` for the auth-route security decisions.

## Self Registration and Account Setup

Public applicants submit only their name and email through `POST /api/v1/registration-requests`. The API always returns the same accepted response for valid requests, while a PostgreSQL backed HMAC rate limit protects the public route. Applicants do not become Better Auth users until an active Super Admin approves them as an `ADMIN` or `MEMBER`.

Approval creates an inactive account and sends a native Better Auth password setup link. A successful setup activates only registration linked users whose setup is still required. Public Better Auth signup remains disabled. Registration receipt, setup, and rejection emails are explicit best effort SMTP events.

Required deployment secrets:

```env
REGISTRATION_RATE_LIMIT_SECRET=
CRON_SECRET=
```

The daily cleanup endpoint is `GET /api/v1/internal/cron/registration-cleanup` with `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`.
